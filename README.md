## Hey there 👋

I’m a Mechatronics & Biomedical Engineering student at McMaster. I build cool things at the crossroads of **mechanical systems + software** — from EV cooling ⚡ to race car validation 🏎️.  

Outside of school, you’ll catch me playing **soccer ⚽**, **violin 🎻**, or doing **graphic design 🎨**.  

### Now
Looking for summer 2026 engineering internships in North America!


### What I was Up To
- Interning in **R&D Engineering @ Dana Incorporated**  
- Building racecars for design teams at McMaster University (Formula SAE and SolarCar) 🚗  
- Cooking up side projects ideas 💡  

### Contact Me
I love meeting new people! Reach me via email [kothandv@mcmaster.ca](mailto:kothandv@mcmaster.ca) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varun-ram/).
